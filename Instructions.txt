Instructions to use this application :

Requirements : You must have Java installed on your machine...

Step 1: You could either use an ide or maybe execute this application via command line..

Step 2 (Optional): Make sure you've a file named as Github PAT.txt in your machine somewhere..
		
		then inside that file make sure to use this particular format to store your github PAT
		
		Personal Access Token : "your PAT token"
		
Note : eliminate "" from the above string 

example : Personal Access Token : ghsdghg452hh1j23hj94j039


Step 3: You just have to browse to your git PAT text file just once, and in future iterations
		
		you can directly copy the github PAT token value to your clipboard... 
		
		And in case you want to change your git text file location you can update the location
		
		and my application is smart enough to keep the track of everything..
		

Step 4 : Enjoy !
